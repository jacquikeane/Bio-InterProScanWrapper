def: "The space external to the outermost structure of a cell. For cells without external protective or external encapsulating structures this refers to space outside of the plasma membrane. This term covers the host cell environment outside an intracellular parasite." [$
comment: Note that this term is intended to annotate gene products that are not attached to the cell surface. For gene products from multicellular organisms which are secreted from a cell but retained within the organism (i.e. released into the interstitial fluid or bloo$

name: pathogenesis

def: "The set of specific processes that generate the ability of an organism to induce an abnormal, generally detrimental state in another organism." [GOC:go_curators]
comment: Note that this term should not be used to annotate gene products that are involved in the host response to pathogenesis. It should only be used to annotate those gene products involved in the generation of pathogenesis by the pathogen itself.
